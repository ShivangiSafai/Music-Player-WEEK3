# Music-Player-WEEK3
The week 3 task submission under Edunet Foundation in collaboration with EY GDS AND AICTE.

Week one task was to create two folders backend and frontend and to integrate them at the end. Development of the login and register functionality in my Spotify Clone project, the frontend uses React.js and Tailwind CSS to create responsive and visually appealing forms with proper validation. Backend development involves Express.js to set up RESTful APIs for handling user registration and login, with password encryption using bcrypt for security. Authentication is managed using JWT to ensure secure access control. MongoDB is utilized to store user credentials and related information. Additionally, the isAuth middleware ensures that only authenticated users can access protected routes, adding an extra layer of security. oast notifications are implemented using a library like react-toastify to provide real-time feedback for user actions, such as successful login, registration, or error handling. Cookies are used for secure storage of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to manage user sessions. Upon successful login or registration, the server generates a token and sends it to the client, where it is stored as an HTTP-only cookie.Axios is used to handle HTTP requests between the frontend and backend. During login or registration, Axios sends user credentials securely to the backend API.
